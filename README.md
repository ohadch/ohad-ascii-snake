2. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## How to Play

Run the game by executing the following command in your terminal:  `python src/snake.py`

Use the arrow keys to move the snake in the desired direction.

Eat the food (represented by `&`) to grow and increase your score.

Avoid hitting the walls or yourself, as that will end the game.
